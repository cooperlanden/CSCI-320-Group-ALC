Project 3- Alec, Luke, cooper

The files we changed were sysproc.c, syscall.h, proc.c, lotterytest.c, and user.h.
We worked on all aspects of the project together; however, we prioritized it. Cooper and Luke worked on proc.c and proc.h and getting set tickets to work. Alec worked on it after that, and then we debugged it together.

Project 4- Alec, Luke, Cooper

The files we changed were memlayout.h, vm.c, and kalloc.c. We also created a file called pgaccess.c.
All parts of the project were worked on together in the computer lab however we had priority for different parts of the project. Cooper worked on part 1 and Luke worked on part 2. We had some issues on part 1 and 2 which alec debugged but all parts of the project were worked on together.
