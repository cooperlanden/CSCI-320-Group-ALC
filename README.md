Project 3- Alec, Luke, cooper

The files we changed were sysproc.c, syscall.h, proc.c, lotterytest.c, and user.h.
We worked on all aspects of the project together; however, we prioritized it. Cooper and Luke worked on proc.c and proc.h and getting set tickets to work. Alec worked on it after that, and then we debugged it together.

Project 4- Alec, Luke, Cooper

The files we changed were memlayout.h, vm.c, and kalloc.c. We also created a file called pgaccess.c.
All parts of the project were worked on together in the computer lab however we had priority for different parts of the project. Cooper worked on part 1 and Luke worked on part 2. We had some issues on part 1 and 2 which alec debugged but all parts of the project were worked on together.

Project 5- Alec, Luke, Cooper

Initially the main file we worked on was the dining_philosophers.c file that we created to solve the first problem in the project. Cooper and Alec worked on creating that file that created synchronization between the philosohpers and when they wait, think, and eat. Luke created and implemented the file called barbershop.c that solves the section part of the project. Although, all members worked on different portions of the project, as a whole we helped each other with troubleshooting and overcoming errors in our code.
