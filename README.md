Project 4- Alec, Luke, Cooper

The files we changed were memlayout.h, vm.c, and kalloc.c. We also created a file called pgaccess.c.
All parts of the project were worked on together in the computer lab however we had priority for different parts of the project. Cooper worked on part 1 and Luke worked on part 2. We had some issues on part 1 and 2 which alec debugged but all parts of the project were worked on together.
